# Welcome to my second readme file
Welcome to **my 0x01-git** repo created for **ALX SE Training**. This repository will be used as a library for all my code base through this program.
You can always refer to the README.md for guidance if you are lost.
I know it's look a bit scanty now, no worries work is still in progress!
**Once again welcome aboard and smooth sail!**
